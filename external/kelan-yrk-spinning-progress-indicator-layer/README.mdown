Please feel free to send me questions or comments.


## Version History

* v1.0  2008-07-08  Initial Release.
* v1.1  2009-02-14  Fixes from Eric Roccasecca.
* v1.2  2011-07-17  CGFloat fix from Eloy Duran, and other cleanup.


## Overview

YRKSpinningProgressIndicatorLayer is a clone of the NSProgressIndicator
(spinning-style) that can be set to an arbitrary size and color, and used with
CoreAnimation layers.


## Features

* Implemented as a subclass of CALayer.
    * Can be used with and overlaid on other CALayers.
* Can be set to arbitrary size and color.
    * Can even be changed while animating.
* Has nice, subtle animation effects
    * Upon starting animation, each "fin" appears only when it is first drawn.
    * When animating, each fin fades from opaque to transparent.
    * As they fade, you can see through the fins to the background.
    * When stopped, no new fins are drawn, and the existing fins fade to transparent,


## Code Architecture

* Implemented as a subclass of CALayer.
    * Each fin is a sub-layer made of a generic CALayer and drawn by setting the
      bounds, corner radius, and background color.
* Animation is done with an NSTimer.


## Notes/Limitations

* If resized really fast, some fins will not be drawn.
* When drawn a large size (i.e. full-screen), the animation can take up
  a pretty good chunk of CPU. But, at smaller sizes, it's not bad.
    * The good news is that since it's Leopard-only, it won't be running
      on anything slower than 800mhz/512MB ram.
    * I tested it on my PPC revA Mac Mini that is 1.25Ghz/512MB (and
      weak graphics), and it ran OK at everything except full-screen.
    * The QC composition in the background of the demo app was a much
      bigger culprit though, and with the solid background, it is ok.
    * So, hopefully the performance is acceptable. If not, I have an
      idea for caching all the fin images, instead of having
      CoreAnimation do all the drawing on the fly. But, the way it is
      now makes for really clean code, so I left it like that for now.
* For some reason, the Quartz Composer background (with the clouds)
  of the SPILDemo app sometimes doesn't animate when built in Release mode.
  But, this appears to be fixed on 10.6.


## Code Conventions

* Instance variables are prefixed with an underscore (i.e. "_").
* "Private" methods are declared in a Class Continuation (i.e. name-less
  category) at the top of the .m file.
