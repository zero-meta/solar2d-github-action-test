Changes since the last public release (1.2.42):

version 1.2.43beta01 [January 27, 2010]
  Updated CMakeLists.txt for consistent indentation and to avoid an
    unclosed if-statement warning (Philip Lowman).
  Removed "#ifdef PNG_1_0_X / #endif" surrounding
    PNG_READ_16_TO_8_SUPPORTED and PNG_READ_GRAY_TO_RGB_SUPPORTED
    in pngconf.h.  These were added in libpng-1.2.41beta08 and libpng-1.0.51,
    which introduced a binary incompatibility with libpng-1.0.50.
  Backported new png_decompress_chunk() algorithm from libpng-1.4.1
