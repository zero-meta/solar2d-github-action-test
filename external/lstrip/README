lstrip compresses Lua programs by removing comments and whitespace,
including line breaks. By default, lstrip removes all line breaks.
Use "lstrip -p" to preserve some line breaks.
Use "lstrip -p -p" to preserve all line breaks.

lstrip can also dump the token stream with -d. In this mode, for each
token lstrip outputs a line with the line number, the token, and its
value, separated by tabs.

To try lstrip, just edit Makefile to reflect your installation of Lua
and then run make. This will build lstrip and run a simple test. Note
that lstrip needs inside information from the Lua private headers and
so it needs to be built using a Lua build directory, not just the usual
installation directories.
