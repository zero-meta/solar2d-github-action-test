Summary:
Angle is an open source project that allows an OpenGL enabled application to render to Direct3D instead.  It does this by providing its own OpenGL libraries which provides all of the standard OpenGL and OpenGL ES functions.  Those OpenGL functions would then call the equivalent Direct3D function calls.

The contents under the "Project" directory contains Microsoft's fork of the Angle project which supports Windows Phone 8 and Windows RT store apps.  This project can be found here...
   https://github.com/MSOpenTech/angle

How to build:
1) Go to a Windows 8.1 machine.
2) Ensure that Visual Studio 2013 with Windows Phone support has been installed.
3) Execute the "Build.bat" file. (You can do this by double clicking the file.)
4) The build results will be under the "bin" directory.

How to update the Angle project and libraries:
1) Go to website...  https://github.com/MSOpenTech/angle
2) Click on the "Download ZIP" button.
3) Unzip the downloaded file.
4) Delete file tree under this folder's "Project" directory.
5) Copy the unzipped file tree to the "Project" directory.
6) Build the library by double clicking on the "Build.bat" file.
7) Commit the newly built libraries under the "bin" directory to Corona Labs' repository.
8) Commit the updated "Project" files to Corona Labs' repository, but do not commit the intermediate files generated by the compiler.
