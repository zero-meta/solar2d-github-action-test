You acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of Corona’s Proprietary Information, there can be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of its obligations hereunder, that any such breach may allow You or third parties to unfairly compete with Corona resulting in irreparable harm to Corona, and therefore, that upon any such breach or threat thereof, Corona shall be entitled to injunctions and other appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies it may have at law (without the requirement of posting a bond). The parties shall be independent contractors under this Agreement, and nothing herein shall constitute either party as the employer, employee, agent, or representative of the other party, or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose.
